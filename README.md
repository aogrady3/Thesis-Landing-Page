## Thesis Coding Assessment 

Page is created using HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I added some interactions when a user hovers over certain buttons and or clickable events! In additon I used font awesome to add the additional icons.

### Extra Credit 

In the original mock-up for the landing page there is a menu bar icon with it's contents located to the right of the menu bar icon. I thought this defeated the purpose of the menu bar icon. I therefore altered the mockup and created an interative menu bar icon, using Javascript. So when clicked it will display the contents on the right hand side of the webpage.
